# A library for variational quantum algorithms

## Background
This library provides quantum circuits for variational quantum algorithms, which are an approach to quantum computing that utilizes classical optimization techniques to find the optimal parameters for a quantum circuit to solve a given problem. The circuits provided in this library are used to benchmark the performance of optimizers introduced in the paper "Optimizing Variational Quantum Algorithms with qBANG: A Hybrid Approach to Tackle Flat Energy Landscapes" [[arXiv](UPDATE LINK)].

## Installation and use


The package `qflow` is prepared such that it can be installed in development mode locally (such that any change in the code is instantly reflected). To install `qflow` locally, clone/download the repository and run the following command from the qflow folder:

```
pip install -e .
```

Then, run any of the notebooks in the example folder to play around with variational quantum circuits. 

To run the quantum chemistry examples you need to install [pyscf](https://pyscf.org/).
